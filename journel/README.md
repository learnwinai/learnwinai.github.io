  1. I really now think about her, Smile, she must be a person of god, the way she came, she stayed and she went, an arc that doesn't come around very much.
  2. How to master discipline, Odysseus Ulysses pact, he says having the following is necessary for all to work out. The plan, The "tying up", The temptation, The resistance, The successful passage.
  How should I log it for me.

**Putting it all together**

For personal reflection, you can log Odysseus's journey in a journal, but the format and focus can vary based on what part of the story you wish to capture for yourself

. There is no single "right" way to do it; the goal is to make it meaningful for your own self-reflection or growth. 

Here are several methods for logging the story of Odysseus, inspired by different journaling techniques: 

Option 1: The discipline log 

This approach focuses on tracking and reflecting on the theme of self-control and commitment, mirroring Odysseus's discipline to return home. 

- **Format**: Use a notebook, a spreadsheet, or a journaling app.
- **Log entry components:**
    - **The Vow**: Write down your ultimate goal, similar to Odysseus's goal of returning to Penelope and Telemachus.
    - **Daily Obstacles**: At the end of each day, write about a challenge you faced. This can be as simple as resisting a snack or staying on a difficult task at work.
    - **The Siren's Temptation**: Log what temptations arose during the day, how you were affected by them, and your methods of resisting them.
    - **The Mast**: Note the "binding" strategy you used to stay on track, like a habit tracker or a pre-commitment you made to yourself.
    - **Reflection**: Describe how you feel after resisting the temptation. This builds self-awareness and helps you process your emotions. 

Option 2: The hero's journey journal 

This is a more narrative and reflective approach, where you connect your personal experiences to the mythical structure of the hero's journey. 

- **Format**: A physical journal for creative expression and mindfulness.
- **Log entry components**:
    - **The Call to Adventure (Leaving Ithaca)**: Write about a major goal you've set for yourself, why it's important, and the decision to start.
    - **The Trials (Encounters)**: Reflect on specific challenges or failures you face. Write about your feelings during a difficult period, detailing what happened and what you learned from it.
    - **The Ultimate Test (The Sirens' Call)**: Describe a time you faced a serious temptation or distraction. Write about the forces pulling you away from your goal and the strategy you used to overcome them.
    - **The Return (Coming Home)**: Note your progress and celebrate small victories. Describe how you feel as you get closer to your personal goal, and reflect on how you've changed since the beginning. 

Option 3: The bullet journal method 

For a more organized and visual log, use a bullet journal to track habits, goals, and reflections in a structured way. 

- **Format**: A notebook with grid paper is popular for bullet journals.
- **Log entry components**:
    - **Future Log (Home to Ithaca)**: Create a long-term calendar of your key goals.
    - **Monthly Log (Sailing the Seas)**: Map out your monthly schedule and focus points.
    - **Daily Log (The Journey Itself)**: Use a system of bullets to record daily tasks, events, and notes.
    - **Collection (The Siren's Song)**: Create a special page to list the things you need to resist or to set ground rules for yourself. This might be a list of bad habits or mental triggers you want to avoid.
    - **Key Reflection**: Review your entries regularly to spot patterns in your behavior and notice your personal growth. 

General tips for all logging methods 

- **Be honest**: Your log is for you, so write your true feelings without judgment.
- **Schedule your writing time**: Consistency is key to maintaining a log. Make it a regular habit, even if it's just for a few minutes.
- **Don't overthink it**: You don't need perfect grammar or beautiful handwriting. The goal is to capture your thoughts and feelings as they come to you.

  2. I didn't made up my priorities straight.
    - A good way to follow is Steve Jobs 80/20 rule, 80% signal & 20% noise.
    - begin my making a priority list of all the signals and noises, for just one day.
    - start by doing what will work for you in the long run, your purposeful work, called signal.
    - then intermix by doing one noisy work.

- **Write about an Event | Something Notable** : 
  1. Today I was discussing this quote with Abhinav "Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one", and we sorta asked this question that whether a master of one is better in startups perspective or a jack of all trades.
  2. I strongly believe in startup you need to invent something and you're not going into competition with giants at it, so jack of all trades prove to be better when you have a small workforce.
  3. On the other case, I strongly believe the master of one does defeat the jack of all trades in the long run, given a lot of people get invovled into the same comepetion, with lots of resources, like Google vs OpenAI.

  1. The Answer to becoming a CEO comes out to be, the perfect CEO is the one who has the most real world experience, i.e. indiety of real world, because the biggest deal in starting a company or taking a risk or fulfilling tons of resposibility, is quote unquote, "Execution" of the process, and not falling into myths is the path of identity.

- **Write about an Event | Something Notable** : 
  1. Today I was discussing this quote with Abhinav "Jack of all trades, master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one", and we sorta asked this question that whether a master of one is better in startups perspective or a jack of all trades.
  2. I strongly believe in startup you need to invent something and you're not going into competition with giants at it, so jack of all trades prove to be better when you have a small workforce.
  3. On the other case, I strongly believe the master of one does defeat the jack of all trades in the long run, given a lot of people get invovled into the same comepetion, with lots of resources, like Google vs OpenAI.

  1. The Answer to becoming a CEO comes out to be, the perfect CEO is the one who has the most real world experience, i.e. indiety of real world, because the biggest deal in starting a company or taking a risk or fulfilling tons of resposibility, is quote unquote, "Execution" of the process, and not falling into myths is the path of identity.
